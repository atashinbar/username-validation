# Username Validation
Implement the validate function, which accepts a username and returns true if it's acceptable and false if it's not.<br>
A username is valid if it satisfies the following rules:<br>
1- The username must be at least 6 characters long and not exceed 16 characters.<br>
2- The username must contain only letters, numbers and optionally one hyphen (-).<br>
3- The username must start with a letter, and must not end with a hyphen.
